		<p>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political 
		bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate 
		and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the 
		opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
		We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
		Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
		That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the 
		consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, 
		it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its 
		foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
		to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established 
		should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind 
		are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms 
		to which they are accustomed.
